# ScratchTurbo-IntermediateBackendApi
This is a very large clean-up of ScratchTurbo-LegacyBackendApi, and should be used instead of it. This version uses less resources & avoids Data URLs.
A lot of extra features are also added that are not in the old API.

## Code
Yes code is really messy, a newer API is still in development that should have each endpoint in it's own grouped file instead of one large file.

## Contributing
uhh...
